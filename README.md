# Calculator
# Exercise provided by The Odin Project

For the last task of TOP's "Foundations" part I was supposed to write a simple calculator that can handle the following operations:
- addition
- multiplication
- division
- subtraction

Furthermore, my task consisted of:
- styling it appropriately in CSS
- letting the user string operations
- thrown an error when division through 0 occurs
- round solutions with long decimal numbers
- implement a clear button

While there is some functionality that I would like to add in the future I am overall satisfied with the final result. 
Especially considering that styling & design is not my strong suit, I think it's not too horrible on the eyes.
